# QuizScraper

A scrapy spider-based script for fetching the Guardian Weekend quiz and
rendering it in the Whitaker family's format of choice (questions first, then
repeat the questions with answers interleaved), in a Markdown format suitable
to be piped into [Deckset](http://www.decksetapp.com), so that I can put the
quiz up on the telly by "projecting" it to the Apple TV.

This is an extremely specific use case. :)
